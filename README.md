# Practice Project Overview

In the practice project, you will be introduced to embeddable Watson AI libraries. Then, you will create a web app integrated with Watson AI libraries to perform sentiment analysis on the provided text. After developing the app, you will deploy the said application over the web using Flask framework. All activities that get you to deploy a functional AI-based web apps are broken down into tasks as listed below:

* <p style="margin-bottom: 4px;">Task 1: Clone the project repository</p>
* <p style="margin-bottom: 4px;">Task 2: Create a sentiment analysis application using Watson NLP library</p>
* <p style="margin-bottom: 4px;">Task 3: Format the output of the application</p>
* <p style="margin-bottom: 4px;">Task 4: Package the application</p>
* <p style="margin-bottom: 4px;">Task 5: Run Unit tests on your application</p>
